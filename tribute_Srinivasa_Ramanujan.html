    <li> Srinivasa Ramanujan (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920)
    <li>Ramanujan was born in his grandmother's house in Erode, a small village about 400 km southwest of Madras (now
      Chennai). When Ramanujan was a year old his mother took him to the town of Kumbakonam, about 160 km nearer Madras.
      His father worked in Kumbakonam as a clerk in a cloth merchant's shop. In December 1889 he contracted smallpox.
    <li>When he was nearly five years old, Ramanujan entered the primary school in Kumbakonam although he would attend
      several different primary schools before entering the Town High School in Kumbakonam in January 1898. At the Town
      High School, Ramanujan was to do well in all his school subjects and showed himself an able all round scholar. In
      1900 he began to work on his own on mathematics summing geometric and arithmetic series.
    <li>Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902 and he went on to find his own method to solve the
      quartic. The following year, not knowing that the quintic could not be solved by radicals, he tried (and of course
      failed) to solve the quintic.
    <li>By 1904 Ramanujan had begun to undertake deep research. He investigated the series ∑(1/n) and calculated Euler's
      constant to 15 decimal places. He began to study the Bernoulli numbers, although this was entirely his own
      independent discovery.
    <li>In 1911 Ramanujan approached the founder of the Indian Mathematical Society for advice on a job. After this he
      was appointed to his first job, a temporary post in the Accountant General's Office in Madras. It was then
      suggested that he approach Ramachandra Rao who was a Collector at Nellore. Ramachandra Rao was a founder member of
      the Indian Mathematical Society who had helped start the mathematics library.
    <li>He was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India. Though he had almost no formal
      training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite
      series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.
      Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: "He tried to interest the leading
      professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too
      unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered". Seeking mathematicians who
      could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy
      at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to
      travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that Hardy
      said had "defeated him and his colleagues completely", in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly
      advanced results.
    <li>On 18 February 1918 Ramanujan was elected a fellow of the Cambridge Philosophical Society and then three days
      later, the greatest honour that he would receive, his name appeared on the list for election as a fellow of the
      Royal Society of London. He had been proposed by an impressive list of mathematicians, namely Hardy, MacMahon,
      Grace, Larmor, Bromwich, Hobson, Baker, Littlewood, Nicholson, Young, Whittaker, Forsyth and Whitehead. His
      election as a fellow of the Royal Society was confirmed on 2 May 1918, then on 10 October 1918 he was elected a
      Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge, the fellowship to run for six years.
    <li>Ramanujan sailed to India on 27 February 1919 arriving on 13 March. However his health was very poor and,
      despite medical treatment, he died there the following year.
    <li>Ramanujan left a number of unpublished notebooks filled with theorems that mathematicians have continued to
      study. G N Watson, Mason Professor of Pure Mathematics at Birmingham from 1918 to 1951 published 14 papers under
      the general title Theorems stated by Ramanujan and in all he published nearly 30 papers which were inspired by
      Ramanujan's work. Hardy passed on to Watson the large number of manuscripts of Ramanujan that he had, both written
      before 1914 and some written in Ramanujan's last year in India before his death.
